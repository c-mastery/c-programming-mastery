    description: "Filling the gaps and embracing C23: type casting and how implicit conversions can silently ruin your day, command-line arguments so your programs can behave like real Unix tools, const correctness as a tool for correctness and self-documentation, how loops are just jumps under the hood and what cache locality means for performance, atomics for safe shared state between threads, and a comprehensive stdlib deep dive covering the functions you'll reach for constantly. Plus C23 additions — strdup, stdbit.h, checked arithmetic — and a capstone project tying everything together. The final lesson points you toward the real C codebases, tools, and references that will take you from 'knows C' to 'thinks in C'.",

            explanation: "C's type system is static — every variable has a fixed, known type — but C is unusually permissive about mixing types. Some conversions happen automatically and silently: <code>int</code> to <code>double</code>, <code>char</code> to <code>int</code>. Others require an explicit cast. The danger is that C's implicit conversion rules are not always what you'd expect. The most notorious: mixing a signed integer with an unsigned one causes the signed value to be reinterpreted as unsigned, making <code>-1 < 1U</code> evaluate as <em>false</em> (because -1 becomes 4,294,967,295). Integer division between two ints silently truncates instead of producing a decimal. These are not bugs in C — they follow directly from the hardware's two's complement arithmetic and the principle of 'no overhead you didn't ask for'. They are, however, responsible for a remarkable number of real security vulnerabilities and incorrect calculations in production software. Understanding them precisely is what separates code that works on your machine from code that works everywhere.",

This is called implicit conversion or arithmetic promotion. The general rule is that smaller types are promoted to larger ones: <code>char</code> → <code>int</code> → <code>long</code> → <code>float</code> → <code>double</code>. The result takes the type of the larger operand.",

Understanding this explains loop unrolling, cache locality, and branch prediction — three phenomena that are responsible for the majority of real-world C performance differences.

            explanation: "Reading about a concept and applying it under real constraints are two completely different things. Every module so far has presented each feature in isolation — a lesson on structs, a lesson on file I/O, a lesson on dynamic memory. The capstone project forces you to combine all of them simultaneously, which is where the real learning happens. You will discover that file formats need careful struct layout decisions, that error handling in file I/O interacts with dynamic memory cleanup, that command-line argument parsing requires type conversion and validation, and that a Makefile is not optional once you have multiple source files. The spec is intentionally open-ended in places — ambiguity is deliberate. Professional C programming means making and defending design decisions, not following a recipe.",
