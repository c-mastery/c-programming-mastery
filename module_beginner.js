            explanation: "Every C program, regardless of whether it's a 5-line toy or a 5-million-line operating system, follows the same fundamental structure. This is not ceremonial boilerplate invented to annoy beginners — every single piece exists because something in the compilation process or the operating system requires it. The reason C programs have a <code>main()</code> function is that the OS's program loader needs one fixed, agreed-upon entry point to jump to when starting your program. The reason you <code>#include</code> headers is that the compiler processes one file at a time and needs to see the 'signature' of any function before you can call it. Understanding the 'why' behind each piece is what separates programmers who can debug new situations from those who can only cargo-cult copy examples they don't understand. Let's dissect every line.",

The power of a computer comes from its ability to make decisions at runtime — to take different paths through code based on conditions that are only known when the program is actually running. Conditional statements are that decision mechanism. In C, there is no separate 'boolean' type at the hardware level — every condition evaluates to an integer: zero means false, and any non-zero value means true. This isn't a quirk or a shortcut; it's a direct reflection of how CPUs work. Comparison instructions set bits in a status register, and branch instructions read those bits.

            answer: 1,
            explanation: "return 0 from main signals successful program termination to the OS. Non-zero conventionally means an error occurred. This is how shell scripts check if a program succeeded."

            answer: 1,
            explanation: "== is the equality comparison operator. = is assignment. This is one of the most common beginner bugs: writing if (x = 5) assigns 5 to x instead of comparing."

            answer: 1,
